	<h3> Form Creation and Layout: </h3>
	<p>I have successfully applied a responsive registration form to my webpage, using Bootstrap’s form components. The form includes input fields for First Name, Last Name, Email, and Password, as well as a checkbox to agree to the terms and conditions. I utilized Bootstrap’s grid layout to place the First Name and Last Name fields side-by-side for a cleaner, more organized layout. Validation classes were applied to make the Email and Password fields required, ensuring basic input validation. The form also features a clearly styled Submit button using the classes btn-sm and btn-primary.</p>

	<h3> Table for Displaying Data: </h3>
	<p>I completed the data collection simulation by adding a Bootstrap-styled table below the registration form. To mimic user submissions, I hard-coded sample user data directly into the table. For improved readability, I applied striped and hoverable row styles. Additionally, I wrapped the table in a table-responsive div to ensure it displays properly on all screen sizes.</p>

	<h3> Image and Button Utilities: </h3>
	<div>
		<p>I selected the following images for my webpage which are both responsive by using Bootstrap’s img-fluid class and placing them inside a container-fluid to span the full width of the page. Below the main image, I included a circular image using the rounded-circle class for visual variety.</p>

		<p> Additionally, I created two buttons: one that remains visible across all screen sizes,...</p>

		<p>and another that is hidden on small screens using the d-none d-md-block utility classes to demonstrate responsive display behavior.</p>

	<h3> Responsive Navigation Bar: </h3>
	<p>for this project I built a responsive navigation bar using Bootstrap components. The navbar includes links to the Home, About, and Contact sections. It is fully responsive, collapsing into a hamburger menu on smaller screens for better mobile usability. Bootstrap’s utilities and built-in classes were used to style the navbar and ensure consistent behavior across different devices.</p>

	<h3> Responsiveness and Layout: </h3>
	<p>Over all I've successfully structured the layout of this webpage using Bootstrap containers, utilizing both container and container-fluid where appropriate to maintain proper spacing and alignment. All components are designed to be fully responsive across various screen sizes by leveraging Bootstrap’s built-in responsive utilities, ensuring a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
